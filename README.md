==========

This is my HTML5 template for projects.  I use the HTML5 Boilerplate plus a simple CSS framework.  I also use Sass.  I'm using a version of Foldy960 from Paravel.

Update:  I've added several mixins for common patterns.  One of those mixins is to create a custom grid making any sort of framework obsolete.  I've also updated my Sass to SCSS to make it more similar to CSS.
